According to GitStats, YACS has been active for nearly a year now. They have 201 files and 44,169 lines of code in total. Although the YACS website lists 90 contributors, there are really only 23 authors. Looking at the activity graphs, we can see that most of the commits were made in February-April and October-December, which lines up with the Fall and Spring semesters. Jacob Shomstein is the author of the first commit; in fact, he made the most commits. However, Joshua Wu contributed with the most lines.

GitStats shows that the project has 27,772 lines of code in total and 35 authors. I’m guessing the difference in lines of code is because GitStats potentially does not include non-code files like READMEs. Activity mostly stopped about 2 months ago (9 weeks) but has picked up slowly within the past week. This explains the most recent commit happening on February 9th in the email-system branch. A large portion of the commits happen at 16:00 and on Tuesdays/Fridays, which makes sense since this is when RCOS is ongoing.
