### Smart Questions How to Ask Questions the Smart Way
#### More Suggestions
1. Compile all your questions beforehand, so when you have a chance to meet with whoever's helping you, you can address them all at once. This will also prevent you from forgetting any questions you had.
2. When asking your question, provide some examples, or explain to them how they can recreate the issue.
3. This is similar to the "Choose your forum carefully" section of the article, but when I was working remotely from a different timezone than my team, I found it beneficial to ask simpler questions (ones that I knew would have a short response) through DMs and the more complex ones through a video call.

### Free Culture Chapter 3
Jesse Jordan used Microsoft's network file system to improve on RPI's search engine. The directory of this search engine supported all types of different files, but a fraction of them were music files. Jesse didn't intend for there to be so many music files, nor did he play any role in users adding music files. However, he was sued by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) for violating copyright laws. They claimed that by operating his network, Jesse was pirating their music. It seems like a very unfair lawsuit, and the RIAA seemed to only be interested in taking away Jesse's money and platform. It's kind of unfortunate that large companies have so much power, and yet they still choose to pick fights with people who don't have the same amount of power. In fact, this happened to 3 other students as well.

### Open Source Project
While scrolling through Reddit one day, I saw a post on the RPI subreddit regarding an app similar to RateMyProfessor but for landlords around RPI. As a student looking for housing, it's difficult to tell whether someone would be a good landlord or not.  However, this is very essential information because he/she will be someone you would have to work with for an extensive period of time. The author of the post linked to an app like this called offcmpus, but the beta version is only being released in April 2021. I couldn't find any source code for it, so I think making an open source version would be nice.  After reading this post, I tried to look for similar apps that are open source. Aptoide is a free open source alternative to Anrdoid's Play Store. The feature I'm most interested by here is the rating and reviewing system; I think this is something I could adopt or take inspiration from if I were to work on the idea from the RPI subreddit.
