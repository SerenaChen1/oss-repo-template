### Creative Commons License
[License](https://github.com/SerenaChen1/oss-repo-template/blob/master/LICENSE)

### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
For software to be considered free, it must grant the end user 4 freedoms:
freedom to use the program for any purpose, study to software and make
changes to it, distribute it to others, and distribute your modified versions of
it. Licenses are legal documents that dictate what rights a user has to a piece
of code. They allow people to use the software without violating any copyrights.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
Using software that doesn't have an explicit license can be risky because you
have not been granted any rights to the owner's code. This is considered
copyright infringement, which is punished by law.

### Why the Web Beat Gopher (Failure to Follow the Open Systems Model)
#### Do you agree?
I agree with this claim; one of the pillars of the open source model is to have
many eyes looking at the code, which (in theory) would lead to quicker progress.
Developers would be more likely to work on projects that will benefit them, and
in adding a license that discriminates against certain people, Gopher lost the
trust of many developers, thus failing to build a community. It also seems that
after losing its users, Gopher lost its sense of direction, no longer knowing
what it wanted to concentrate on.

### Can you justify why a license is chosen based on the history, goals, and philosophy of the project?
The Linux kernel was created by Linus Torvalds, whose goal was to create a new,
free operating system kernel. The original license on Linux prevent commercial
redistribution, but he eventually switched to the GPLv2 license, which demands
that human-readable code be available to users and modified versions of the
software be distributed under the same license. This prevented the two main ways
that software distributers tried to circumvent freeness of their software. This
license allowed the project to be commercialized and grow from an operating
system meant for just personal computers to one that is used on all types of
platforms. Even to this day, the main goals of Linux is to encourage more use
of the software. Some developers of the Linux kernel express, "We want companies
and individuals to use, modify and distribute this software.  We want to work
with users in an open and transparent way to eliminate any uncertainty about our
expectations regarding compliance or enforcement that might limit adoption of
our software." <br />
